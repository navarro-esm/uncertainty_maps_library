# Uncertainty maps for model-based global climate classification systems

<div align="justify">  Climate classification systems (CCSs) are emerging as essential tools in climate change science for mitigation and adaptation. However,
their limitations are often misunderstood by non-specialists. This situation is especially acute when the CCSs are derived from Global
Climate Model outputs (GCMs). We present a set of uncertainty maps of four widely used schemes -Whittaker-Ricklefs, Holdridge,
Thornthwaite-Feddema and Köppen- for present (1980-2014) and future (2015-2100) climate based on 52 models from the Coupled
Intercomparison Model Project Phase six (CMIP6). Together with the classification maps, the uncertainty maps provide essential guidance
on where the models perform within limits, and where sources of error lie. We share a digital resource that can be readily and freely
integrated into mitigation and adaptation studies and which is helpful for scientists and practitioners using climate classifications,
minimizing the risk of pitfalls or unsubstantiated conclusions.   </div>

<div align="justify"> The dataset includes climate classification maps and their associated consensus maps for present climate and three future socio-economic pathways (SSPs). 
These maps represent the Earth's climate zones according to four well-established classification schemes: Holdridge, Köppen, Thornthwaite, and Whittaker. 
The data are based on Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase six (CMIP6). To download the GeoTIFF, NetCDF and Bil files go to https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28071410.
