This folder contains three programs written in python.
The workflow is as follows:

Part 01 (kappa.py)
	This program takes the bil files generated by the classifiers and
	calculates the kappa statistic using the sklearn package. You need to write
	a bash script that loops through all the models' filenames.
    
	INPUT PARAMETERS:
		file1-> path+ reference filename (bil)
		file2-> path+ model filename (bil)
		case->  historical
		cclas-> climate classification scheme (holdridge, thornthwaite...)
	OUTPUT FILE:
		txt file with kappa statistic.



Part 02 (r2_app_at.py)
	This program computes the coefficient of determination for all models
	using CRU data as reference. You need to write a bash script that loops 
	through all the models' filenames.

	OUTPUT FILE:
		txt file with R2 for precipitation and temperature


Part 03 (scatter.py)
	This program takes the kappa scores from climate classification schemes
	and R2 scores from precipitation and temperature for individual models and
	then selects the best models (T10). 

	INPUT PARAMETER:
		CNAME ("holdridge","whittaker", ...)
	INPUT DATA:
		(1) precipitation.txt
		(2) temperature.txt
		(3) modelnames.txt
		(4) kappa-scores.txt
	OUTPUT DATA:
		Scatter plot (x1)
		Txt file listing  top-10 models for the selected classification scheme
		(modelname, kappa, R2 pr, R2 ts).
